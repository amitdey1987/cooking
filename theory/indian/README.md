# Pressure Cooking

Measure cooking by time since first whistle, rather than total number of whistles.

|Ingredient|Soak Time|Pressure Cook Time|
|-|-|-|
|Beans||3 mins|
|Beetroot Cubed||6 mins|
|Broccoli Florets||2 mins|
|Cauliflower Florets||3 mins|
|Carrot Chunks||4 mins|
|Potato Small||6 mins|
|Potato Large||10 mins|
|Colocasia||3 mins|
|Tapioca Chunks||3 mins|
|Moong||6 mins|
|Toor||8 mins|
|Chana Dal|30 mins|15 mins|
|Chickpea|8 hours|20 mins|
|Black Urad|8 hours|20 mins|
|Rajma|8 hours|20 mins|
|Lobis|8 Hours|10 mins|
# Rice
1. Wash rice until water runs clear (removes sticky starch)
2. Add water to rice until first knuckle (better measure than ratio as takes into consideration evaporation).
3. Bring to boil (starches gelatinize).
4. Place a lid and reduce heat to lower possible setting. Wait for water to be absorbed (~15 minutes).
5. Turn-off heat, let rest with lid closed (10 minutes) (retrogradation. grain separates).

# Vegetables
1. Organic tastes better because they produce more defence mechanisms against pest which taste good.
2. Chopping vegetables trigger reactions. So whole garlic taste different (light) from chopped (heavy).
3. Keep chopped vegetables in cold water with lime juice to prevent oxidization.
4. Boil with salted water to prevent losing flavor.
5. Steam better than boil to retain texture.
   
**Minimal Vegetable Side Dish - Steam vegetable, Brown in Oil, Add spices, turn-off stove.**

# Meat 
1. Composed of Fat (tasteless but transports flavor), proteins, and connective-tissues (provides succulence).
2. Proteins cook at 55-65 C, but connective-tissues cook at 65-70 C. Hard to balance.
3. Brining is better than Marination to impart flavor, and retain moisture in meat.
4. Thaw for multiple hours in refrigerator, or 15 minutes under running watrer at 40 C.

# Eggs
1. Add baking sofa during boiling eggs to make peeling easy.
2. Before making scramnled eggs or omelette, add salt to broken egg 15 mins before cooking.

# Fats
1. Fats transport flavor. So spices are added to hot oil.
2. Each fat has a smoke point beyond which it will burn.
3. Virgin or unrefined oil have lower smoke point so not suitable for deep frying. Better to use refined oil.
4. Keep oil in dark, cool, air-tight to avoid going rancid.

|Fat|Smoke Point(C)|Deep Frying|
|-|-|-|
|Butter|150|No|
|Ghee|250|Yes|
|Refined Coconut Oil|232|
|Virgin Coconut Oil|177|
|Refined Olive Oil|200|
|Virgin Olive Oil|160|
|Vegetable Oil|220|

# Taste
|Base Taste|Added Taste|Amount Added|Effect|Example|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Sweet|Salt|Low/Medium|Enhanced|Kheer, Jaggery|
|Sour|Salt|Low|Supressed|Yogurt|
|Sour|Sweet|Medium|Supressed|
|Sour|Bitter|Medium|Enhanced|
|Bitter|Sweet|Low|Enhanced|
|Bitter|Sour|Low|Enhanced|
|Bitter|Salt|Low/Medium|Supressed|
|Bitter|Sweet|Medium|Enhanced|
|Bitter|Sour|Medium|Supressed|

Taste most sensitive at 20C to 30C.

# Salt
1. Increases aroma, balances sweetness, balances sourness, reduces bitterness.
2. 1-1.5 % salt is tasty and healthy.
3. Avoid Iodized salt for deep-frying and baking as it gives metallic taste.
4. Pink Salt, Rock Salt, Black Salt (aromatic) have lower saltiness. So use more if substituting regular salt.
5. Dehydrades vegetables (Salads).
6. Retains moistures in meat (Brining).

# Sugar
1. Jaggery and Honey are less sweet, but more complex in layers. Honey breaks down with heat.
2. 0.75% sugar in dish makes it sweet.
3. Sugar mutes saltiness, sourness and bitterness.
4. Sugar enhances flavors in spices.

# Heat (Chilli)
1. Water doesn't help to subside chilli. Milk, Sugar might help.
2. Green chilli is 4-5x hotter than Kashmiri.
3. Crushsed chilli will be hot, but lose flavor.
4. Heat intensifies other flavors.
5. Fat mutes heat.
6. Sour (Acid) amplifies heat.
7. Heat can reduce perception of richness/fattiness. So add when dish is too creamy/heavy.

# Flavor
Portion of population can't handle raw cilantro, but everyone can eat in paste form.

Affect of taste on spice flavor
1. Salt amplifies
2. Sweet amplifies
3. Bitter have strong aroma
4. Sour balances flavors, makes multiple flavor standout
5. Umami makes spice linger
6. Heat make spice pleasurable
7. Fat transports flavor.

# Extracting Flavor
Amount of flavor depends on
1. Mechanical Damage : Whole < Cut < Chop < Smash < Mince < Grind.
2. How you cook - Dry-Roast, Oil-Roast, Boil.
3. How long - Longer means less intensity
4. What you pari with - acid, fat, salt, sugar.

## Dry Spice (Black Pepper, Cardomom, Conammon, Clove)
1. Mechanical Damage : Fine Grind > Coarse Grind > Whole.
4. Powder has short shelf life.
5. Dry roasting before damage will extract more flavor
6. Oil roasting before damage will extract most flavor
7. Add near end of cooking for more flavor.

## Dry Herbs (fenugreek or dried mint)
1. Crush before use for most flavors
2. Best added near end of cooking

## Fresh Spices (ginger garlic)
1. Paste > Mince > Rough Chop > Whole

## Fresh Herbs (Coriander Curry Leaves)
1. Paste > Mince > Rough Chop > Whole
2. Use paste immediately

## Exceptions
1. Saffron soaked in milk to extract.
2. Mustard soaked in water before grinding to paste.

Flavors work best with layering. e.g. For Aloo jeera, do ALL of these
1. Heat Jira with Oil in beginning
2. Add roasted Jira powder during cooking
3. Tadka with Jeera
4. Jeera infused oil for finishing.

# Spice Mix
1. Pick one (or 2) flavor categroy
2. Pick one spice from each of the selected flavor category
3. For each spice, pick another spice form any category with atleast one common flavor molecule (see masala lab book)

# Browning
## Onions
### Types
1. Yellow/Brown - Most flavorful
2. Purple - Less flavorful. Suitable for salads
3. White - Sweet used for mediterranean or mexican
4. Shallow - Not Onion. Sweeter. Used for south-indian and south-east-asian curry.
### Flavor
1. Mechanical Damage - Mince > Slice across bulb > Slice along bulb.
### Stages of heating
1. Sweating - Slightly wilted. Still crunchy.
2. Translucent - Fully wilted. No Crunch. Milder taste, suitable for korma.
3. Light Browning - Maillard reaction. Suitable for stronger curry like tikka masala.
4. Golden Brown - Must babysit can burn. Suitable for roghan josh, bhuna.
5. Caramelization - Low and slow. Slighlty sweet. Put on bread or in gujrati dishes.

## Garlic
1. Mechanical Damage - Mince > Chopped > Whole
2. Can get burned quickly. Cook on medium heat. Or cook after onion, so it can stay safe in onion water.
3. Caramelized garlic can be made in oven. Wrap entire bulb of garlic in foil paper. Can be added to chutney.

## Potato
1. Parboil with baking soda. This creates grooves for cripier frying layer.

## Mailard reaction
1. Don't move thing on pan which you want to brown
2. Oven takes longer but more uniform
3. Consider browning any many ingredients as possible before adding to gravy

## Frying
1. Happens at 170C. Saute happens in 110-150C.
2. Outer layer instantly dehydrate to form a waterproof crust.
3. Moisture retains inside due to crust. Heat continues to go inside.
4. Outer layer underoes mailard reaction to become delicious.
5. You can only fry something that has sugar and protein. So we use batter or breadcrumbs (starch) to deep-fry chicken.
6. Keep fried food at 93C Oven until consumption.

# Sourness
1. Reduces bitterness
2. Highlights each flavor
3. Minimizes perception of fattiness
4. Balances overly sweet dish
5. Acid in marination help meat absorb flavor molecules like garlic, garam masala.
