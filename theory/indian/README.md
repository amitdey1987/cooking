# Rice
1. Wash rice until water runs clear (removes sticky starch)
2. Add water to rice until first knuckle (better measure than ratio as takes into consideration evaporation).
3. Bring to boil (starches gelatinize).
4. Place a lid and reduce heat to lower possible setting. Wait for water to be absorbed (~15 minutes).
5. Turn-off heat, let rest with lid closed (10 minutes) (retrogradation. grain separates).

# Vegetables
1. Organic tastes better because they produce more defence mechanisms against pest which taste good.
2. Chopping vegetables trigger reactions. So whole garlic taste different (light) from chopped (heavy).
3. Keep chopped vegetables in cold water with lime juice to prevent oxidization.
4. Boil with salted water to prevent losing flavor.
5. Steam better than boil to retain texture.
   
**Minimal Vegetable Side Dish - Steam vegetable, Brown in Oil, Add spices, turn-off stove.**

# Meat 
1. Composed of Fat (tasteless but transports flavor), proteins, and connective-tissues (provides succulence).
2. Proteins cook at 55-65 C, but connective-tissues cook at 65-70 C. Hard to balance.
3. Brining is better than Marination to impart flavor, and retain moisture in meat.
4. Thaw for multiple hours in refrigerator, or 15 minutes under running watrer at 40 C.

# Eggs
1. Add baking sofa during boiling eggs to make peeling easy.
2. Before making scramnled eggs or omelette, add salt to broken egg 15 mins before cooking.
3.
